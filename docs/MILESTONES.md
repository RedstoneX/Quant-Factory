# Quant Factory Milestones

This file is the **only authority for current product direction, active work,
sequencing, blockers, and milestone status**. Supporting documents do not
create a competing queue.

## Current phase

| Item | Current truth |
|---|---|
| Primary goal | Find, reject, and rigorously validate repeatable trading edges. |
| Secondary goal | Convert qualified edges into consistent income using capital-efficient execution. |
| Phase | **Edge discovery and candidate selection.** |
| Active work | **Owner gate:** the fixed MES overnight-gap reversal candidate is rejected. Do not begin another candidate-family screen until the owner accepts a new same-session intraday proposal. |
| Existing assets | The generic candidate runtime is complete. The Decision 310 MES screen has one valid result-bearing run using the checksum-matching owned MES file, complete Databento mapping, clean canonical Git SHA, and licensed VectorBT Pro 2026.4.7. Bitwarden Secrets Manager is operational through the `Codex` machine account scoped to the `Quant Factory` project; the named Databento secret authenticated successfully without paid data. |
| Verified gap | No active intraday candidate is owner-accepted after the MES reversal rejection. The SPY turn-of-month proposal remains a legitimate but **out-of-scope multi-day swing/calendar idea** for the present intraday mandate. Paper, deployment, dashboard, and execution-vehicle work remain unjustified without a surviving edge. |
| Next action | Stop at the explicit owner gate. The owner must accept the next fixed same-session intraday candidate before implementation, data acquisition, or execution. Do not rerun or tune the rejected MES rule. |
| Deferred | Paid options data, broad dashboard repair, deployment, broker expansion, paper activation, and live work until a bounded experiment or qualified edge creates the requirement. |
| Hard boundaries | No protected-test execution, automatic promotion, open-ended optimization, blind data mining, unbounded data acquisition, paper/live orders, or capital exposure during this phase. |

## Active work

<!-- active-work:start -->
| ID | Priority | Status | Depends | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| R11 | 1 | blocked | none | The Decision 310 MES screen is complete and independently audited. Its sole result-bearing run screened out on negative total return, negative annualized return, and Sharpe below 0.5; the candidate is rejected and inactive. Decision 312 establishes Bitwarden Secrets Manager as the machine credential standard. The next candidate requires explicit owner acceptance. |

## Backend completion acceptance — completed 2026-09-29

The backend is ready for edge research when an already-approved candidate can
be carried through the existing research pipeline without inventing another
orchestration layer or manually composing every stage:

1. durable candidate screening launch;
2. real experiment/screening execution and persistence;
3. real runtime adapters for OOS, walk-forward, robustness/regime, and Monte Carlo;
4. persisted stop/advance decisions at each stage;
5. a passing deterministic fixture reaches **protected-test-ready** and stops;
6. failures/replays remain idempotent and fail closed;
7. the path does not depend on dashboard interaction or test-only callbacks.

Use one decisive deterministic proof after implementation. Do not turn backend
completion into repeated fixture testing or another planning exercise.

R10 is complete. `CandidatePipelineRuntime` reuses the durable candidate claim,
actual Prefect flow identity, experiment runner, OOS, walk-forward,
robustness/regime, Monte Carlo, evidence services, and filter-chain coordinator.
The deterministic non-profitability proof reaches protected-test-ready while
the protected state remains gated, persists a failing stop, and proves both
screening and validation-stage failures cannot be reinvoked. The fixture
replaces only the unavailable licensed VectorBT Pro boundary; it proves the
generic runtime orchestration and real validation engines, not deployment,
profitability, or the licensed engine itself.

## Operating sequence

1. Backend completion — COMPLETE
2. **Edge discovery and candidate selection — ACTIVE**
3. Validation of surviving edge
4. Execution-vehicle comparison
5. Trader-usable dashboard repair
6. Paper operation
7. Live operation later

### Edge research — ACTIVE

The current mandate is **day trading / intraday directional edge discovery**.
The fixed MES overnight-gap reversal development screen in
`docs/strategies/mes-overnight-gap-reversal.md` completed and was rejected. It
observed the prior cash-session close and current cash open, entered at 09:35
opposite the gap, and exited at 10:00; no position crossed a session boundary.
Swing, turn-of-month, seasonal, and other calendar-hold strategies are not
current R11 candidates unless the owner explicitly changes the mandate.

### R11 MES development result — rejected 2026-09-30

The sole result-bearing recovery run `run_f7ce514979d64ad0b39b7f933eea7e67`
used the exact Decision 310 configuration, owned checksum-matching MES data, a
complete gap-free 20-interval `MES.c.0` mapping, and VectorBT Pro 2026.4.7. An
earlier durable v1 attempt failed on a loader implementation defect before
producing any result; it remains preserved with zero result evidence. The fixed
v2 recovery is the only accepted candidate evaluation.

- 1,114 completed 25-minute same-session trades across 1,173 sessions;
- 59 exclusions: 43 missing bars, 9 prior early closes, 6 zero gaps, and 1
  missing prior boundary;
- total return: **-4.16386%**;
- annualized return: **-0.90953%**;
- daily Sharpe: **-1.03455**;
- maximum drawdown: **-4.73226%**;
- win rate: **47.2172%**.

Trade count and drawdown passed their gates. Total return, annualized return,
and Sharpe failed, so the conjunctive screen rejected the candidate. All eight
persisted artifacts, the manifest, trade timing, fills, costs, P&L, final
equity, and VectorBT order/trade counts independently validated. No tuning,
rerun, validation, protected-data use, promotion, deployment, or trading is
authorized.

Initial research focuses on S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 behavior. Existing MES/MNQ
intraday history should be reused for cheap first-stage screening where it can
answer the hypothesis. A surviving signal must later be validated on the
intended SPY/QQQ/index underlying before any options edge is claimed, and 0DTE
implementation requires defensible historical option quote/execution evidence.

### Dashboard

The current dashboard is not accepted as the long-term usable interface.
Historical technical evidence and the successful chart-first UX research remain
valuable. Dashboard repair follows a promising edge or begins earlier only if a
measured UI deficiency blocks research.

When resumed, reproduce the approved UX with mature maintained components and
thin Quant Factory adapters. Do not revive the custom prototype as a second
application.

### Paper and live

Paper operation requires a qualified edge, a minimum usable operator path, and
the existing credential, execution, reconciliation, recovery, audit, and
fail-closed gates. Live remains far future and requires separate owner approval.

## Prior work that must not be repeated blindly

- MES ORB is concluded and rejected as an edge candidate.
- MSFT ORB transfer work was withdrawn.
- SPYM momentum and SPY Donchian/RSI work are historical evidence, not current candidates.
- MES overnight-gap reversal is the Decision 310 fixed 25-minute transfer screen. Its audited development result failed the return and Sharpe gates; the candidate is rejected and must not be rerun or tuned.
- Turn-of-month was previously source-attributed and bounded, but its multi-day holding period fails the current intraday/day-trading mission-fit gate. Retain it for possible future swing research; do not backtest it under R11.
- Dashboard design research succeeded as UX research; its custom implementation path was shelved.
